## Executive Summary 
In this summary, I'm going to talk about what we learned from Lab 2,
First, we learned to describe the hardware of information systems,
How to define the basic components of a computer and the functions they perform and explain the effect of converting a personal computer into a commodity.
We learned about solid-state versus hard drive, as well as about ALU, IEEE, hard drive, and memory.
These are the basics that will help us a lot.
 
## Hardware
### Hard Drives and Memory
#### Latency and Transfer Rates
#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives
#### Random Access Memory
### ALU and the Control Unit
### CPU, Input & Output
### Logic Gates 
### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design

## Data Representation
Heading Solid State Drives vs. Hard Drives:
The difference between HDD and SSD disks is in storing data on a small memory stick in the first type, or a large memory disk in the second type, but this difference between an HDD and a structural SSD is translated into a number of very important variables between both.
 
 ## Latency and Transfer Rates: 
In the Hard disk latency, Measured in milliseconds, both search time and spin travel time. The search time metric determines the amount of time a hard drive read/write header takes to find the physical location of a piece of data on the disk. It is easily calculated from the spindle speed, being the time required for half a turn.
Hard drive transfer rates, It is generally described in megabytes per second (MBps).
Host transfer rate is the speed at which the host computer can transfer data via IDE / EIDE or SCSI interface to the CPU. The fastest high-performance drives were capable of average latency of less than 3ms, average search time between 4 and 7ms, and peak data transfer rates in the region of 50 and 60 Mbps for EIDE and SCSI-based drives Straight.

## RAM: Because a computer that has a large RAM can store more programs that are currently running in memory, in the event that the computer's memory runs out, the computer will transfer the non-stored data to the memory in the hard disk drive until it is needed again.
The difference between 64 and 32-bit data paths:
Processor, The type of operating system you are installing depends on the type of processor you have.
The number of operations performed 32-bit processors differ from 64-bit processors in the number of operations they can perform per second.
Memory, the main difference is that a 32-bit system can use 232 bytes of random access memory (RAM) which is about 4 GB.
Software is the most important thing. If you use a 32-bit system, you can install software designed for 32-bit systems only.

## ALU and the Control Unit: 
The central processing unit is a component of a digital computer that interprets instructions and processes the data in the program. The processor, in addition to the main memory and input and output units, is one of the most important components of modern microcomputers. Processors made by integrated circuits are known as microprocessors, which began to be manufactured as integrated chips that replaced most other types of processors. The term central processing unit refers to a class of logic machines that implement complex computer programs, which also includes many ancient computers that existed before the term appeared.

CPU Input: 
In a floating-point unit, it is difficult for the processor to perform arithmetic operations in the presence of a floating-point, that is, those that contain a decimal point, because it needs a lot of processing power to calculate it.
The integer unit is that unit responsible for performing arithmetic operations that contain integers, and it is the most important unit in most programs.
Recorders: The structure of recorders varies between computers, as a number of them include a group of general-purpose recorders and others that contain special-purpose recorders.

## Logic Gates: 
It is an electronic circuit that contains one input or several inputs and one output, as it performs a logical operation on the input and produces the required output.

## IEEE:
IEEE, an association dedicated to advancing innovation and technological excellence for the benefit of humanity, is the world's largest technical professional society, IEEE, pronounced "Eye-triple-E," stands for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. 
There was a secondary focus on wired communication, both the telegraph and the telephone. 

## The heading Hexadecimal Color Representation:
Below, you can see some colors near # ab00ff. Having an array of related colors can be beneficial if you need an inspiring alternative to picking the original color.
